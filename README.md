# Student Performance Analysis 📊

## Project Overview
As a Mathematics teacher, I am interested in understanding patterns in student performance. This project analyzes a dataset of **1,983 student records** to determine how different grade levels (6th, 7th, 8th) perform and identifying grade distributions.

## Objectives
* Clean raw student exam data using **Python** and **Pandas**.
* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand pass/fail rates.
* Visualize grade distributions to assist in educational decision-making.

## Key Insights
* **Dataset Size:** 1,983 students.
* **Average Performance:** The overall average score was **73.2%**.
* **Grade Distribution:**
    * **A:** 526 students
    * **B:** 537 students
    * **C:** 569 students
    * **F:** 351 students
* **Class Balance:** The dataset is evenly distributed across 6th, 7th, and 8th grades.

## Technologies Used
* **Python**: Core programming.
* **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning (handling missing values, calculating percentages).
* **NumPy**: Numerical operations.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install requirements: `pip install pandas numpy`
3. Open `notebooks/Student_Performance_EDA.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
