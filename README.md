# Student Performance Analysis 📊

## Overview
As a Mathematics educator with a background in 6th-8th grade instruction, I analyzed a dataset of student exam scores to understand performance trends across different grade levels. This project explores grading patterns, calculates percentages from raw scores, and segments students based on performance metrics.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean raw exam data (handling missing values and duplicates).
- Engineer features such as `Percentage` and letter `Grades` based on performance.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to compare performance between 6th, 7th, and 8th grades.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Python**: Core language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive analysis.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Grade 8** showed the highest average performance (~74%), slightly outperforming Grades 6 and 7.
- Analysis of grade distribution highlights areas where student support is most needed (high volume of lower-tier grades).

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas numpy`
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook: `Student_Performance_EDA.ipynb`
